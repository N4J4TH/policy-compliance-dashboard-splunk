# Policy Compliance Dashboard Proposal
## Overview

This repository contains the Policy Compliance Dashboard Proposal, a document detailing the design and implementation of a security monitoring dashboard for enforcing Access Control and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policies.

#### The dashboard is intended for organizations operating in sensitive environments, such as financial services, to:

- Monitor successful and failed login attempts

- Track MFA adoption and enforcement

- Identify accounts bypassing MFA

- Detect suspicious authentication patterns

The proposal demonstrates how a Splunk-based solution can provide actionable insights for security teams, enabling early detection of policy violations and potential security threats.
